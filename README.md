# JJS

JJS is an implementation of some aspects of the JavaScript object and primitive world in Java.  
It is a purely recreational and educational project by and for the author.  
Nonetheless, you can use it, as it is freely licenced software.

This repository deliberately breaks some SonarLint rules, so if you use that, add this config:
```json
"sonarlint.rules": {
    "java:S1948": {
        "level": "off"
    },
    "java:S1165": {
        "level": "off"
    }
}
```
